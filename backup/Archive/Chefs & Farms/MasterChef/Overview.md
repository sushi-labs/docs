# Overview

MasterChef is the master of Sushi. He can make Sushi and he is a fair guy.

MasterChef is a core smart contract utilized by Sushi for yield farming, serving as the backbone for distributing SUSHI token rewards to users participating in liquidity provision. The MasterChef contract encourages users to contribute liquidity to the SushiSwap platform by offering incentives in the form of SUSHI tokens.

The MasterChef contract works by adding liquidity pairs or ERC20 tokens and setting allocation points to distribute a constant number of the SUSHI token per block. To take part in the yield farming, users deposit or stake their lp tokens in the MasterChef contract, and in return over time can harvest a portion of the rewards relative to the ratio of their liquidity provided vs total liquidity staked.
