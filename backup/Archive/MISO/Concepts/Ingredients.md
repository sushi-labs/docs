# Ingredients

## It's the freshness and the quality of our ingredients that really sets our MISO apart

Our ingredients, the smart contracts that MISO runs on, are handpicked by Chef Gonpachi himself then carefully cultivated in the MISO garden until they're ready for service. All of the smart contracts used are tried and tested, open-source contracts in use by some of the biggest names in Ethereum and DeFi - specially prepared with a bit of added MISO flavour.

In part due to the story of SushiSwap itself, there is a rising call in the crypto community for open, solid launch mechanisms in all new projects - something SushiSwap benefits from as much as the projects themselves. MISO aims to build on the SushiSwap experience by providing communities and projects easy access to the smart contracts and mechanisms they need to get their token up and trading on SushiSwap, so that they can stay focused on their own success.

Below is a list of the current "Ingredients" used in our MISO kitchen at launch. Check back often as we're always on the look out for new ingredients to add to MISO, so we can leave our customers happy and ready to move on to their main course of Sushi.
