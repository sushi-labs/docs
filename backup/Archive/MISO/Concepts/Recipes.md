# Recipes

## Try our MISO chef selected recipes - or craft your own!

Recipes can combine one or many ingredients to create and launch your own token. We have carefully selected a few of the more interesting combinations as a way to help you get started. You can always build your own MISO from any of our ingredient options, but recipes are a nice way to get everything set up in one transaction.

Recipes set out the flow of a token launch and how the smart contracts will interact with each other; customers will only need to set their parameters and decide which options they wish to use. Once everything is set up, MISO takes over and ensures everything runs smoothly.

We'll be keeping an eye on what people are cooking up to add as recipes in the future, so keep coming back and trying the latest ideas!
