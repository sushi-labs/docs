# MISO SDK

The MISO SDK is a small one, similar to the BentoBox SDK in the sense that almost all of the MISO logic is contained in smart contracts. It contains an address map for all of the MISO contracts, including the Farm, Factory, Launcher and Auction addresses.

The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/sushiswap/sdk/tree/canary/packages/miso-sdk).
