# MISO FAQ

### Why should project leaders use MISO?

Fundamentally, MISO will benefit project leaders by providing hassle-free smart contracts, intuitive UI and customisable launch options. Secondly, being a Sushi integrated platform, MISO will open up projects to a larger initial audience than they may have reached developing and deploying their own launch contracts and campaigns.

### Are the contracts used on MISO going to be audited for security?

The smart contracts used in any MISO ingredient are all open source and have been audited by multiple audit providers. Many of MISO's contract templates are built out from widely adopted standards used throughout the smart contract space, with minimal deviation - full details can be found in the GitHub repo.

### Will all auctions be held in Ether?

No, launch creators will be able to set the auction currency they believe will best benefit their project. Default options for $ETH and stablecoin are available, as well as the ability to assign any custom token for the auction. With MISO’s eventual offering across multiple chains, chain-specific defaults may be built in.

### How does MISO benefit Sushi users and holders?

MISO launches will seamlessly integrate with liquidity pool set up on the SushiSwap platform, increasing overall liquidity and transactions - the direct benefits of additional liquidity and projects on the Sushi exchange are obvious. Holistically, the draw of MISO in bringing new, fledgling communities into the Sushi ecosystem extends far further.

### Will we be able to launch tokens on different chains as well or will MISO start with ETH?

While MISO will launch servicing on Ethereum and Harmony, lots of effort went into making MISO multi-chain alongside the Sushi exchange. This means that the only thing that MISO needs is SushiSwap and the BentoBox, which is already available on 13 exchanges. So absolutely, capabilities will eventually be on any side chain that Sushi is on.

### Will there be functionality that allows you to deploy tokens easily and efficiently?

Yes, we have 3 token types for launch: fixed supply, mintable, and a fork of the famous Sushi governance token. While we believe these options will serve a majority of projects, we also have the ability to use any custom ERC-20 token with our Factory contracts.

### How will tokens on MISO be offered during launch?

The first three iterations of MISO auctions are Crowdsales, Dutch Auctions and Batch Auctions. All three offer their own potential advantages and disadvantages, allowing our markets to meet the needs of a wide range of offerings - while ensuring token offerings are valued respectably for the SushiSwap ecosystem.

### Can projects whitelist buyer addresses?

Yes, these are called MISO Permission Lists. Once set up and deployed alongside an upcoming market, the List will function at its basis to create a "whitelisted" sale - just add in the wallet address and assign them a full allocation. Administrator accounts can be set to manage Permission Lists, allowing these controls to be accessed by community managers, KYC providers or API/bot integration.

### How will liquidity pools work following auctions?

During auction set up, creators will choose an address to receive collected funds upon finalisation. Following a successful auction, project creators will be able to easily add the tokens they raised to a Liquidity launch contract they have created. Once there is an acceptable total of both tokens, the pair is sent to a created liquidity pool on SushiSwap.

With our first Launcher ingredient, _PostAuctionLauncher_, a project creator can set this address to work with a pre-created PostAuctionLauncher contract, allowing them to set a percentage of their auction raise to be sent as the pairing with a preallocated amount of their project token.

### Will we be able to make farming projects as well using MISO?

Projects will be able to set up and deploy Farms using a variation of Sushi’s MasterChef contract during the overall launch creation. Reward tokens can be sent to the Farm and emissions schedules set. Farms can be deployed upon successful market auction. For their supporters, staking and claiming options will be available to easily manage any linked farming opportunities that arise from launches they take part in.
