# Overview

MISO is a suite of open-source smart contracts created to ease the process of launching a new project on the SushiSwap exchange. MISO aims to drive new capital and trade to the exchange by increasing the attractiveness of SushiSwap as a place for token creators and communities to launch new project tokens. We aim to create a launchpad for both technical and non-technical project founders, that will allow communities and projects access to all the options they need for a secure and successful deployment to the SushiSwap exchange.

Similar to other exchanges in the cryptocurrency market, SushiSwap was in need of a launchpad that aligns with the spirit of its userbase - and the projects it wishes to offer. MISO will serve as the SushiSwap communities personal platform for projects to launch on, enabling projects and communities to know that all aspects of a launch are handled through trusted, open source contracts.

### The Ingredients

MISO creates a collection of out-of-the-box smart contracts for non-technical founders to choose over more traditional and code-oriented methods of token launching. Our customers will be able to select and customise their token launch - including initial offering, vault and farm options. MISO functionality is aimed at easing new tokens through their launch and migration of new liquidity into SushiSwap. This suite of contracts, dubbed our "ingredients", are divided into the following groups:

-   **Tokens** - Options for tokens for projects; token types include Fixed Supply, Mintable & $SUSHI Token

-   **Market** - Contracts for initial token offerings; choose from Crowdsale, Dutch & Batch Auction, as well as how you'd like to manage participation

-   **Liquidity** - Easy liquidity migrations; set a portion of raised funds to create a new SushiSwap pool and migrate trustlessly

-   **Fermentation** - Vaulting/escrow options for locking up (and releasing) tokens over time

-   **Farm Produce** - Fresh tokens can be farmed for rewards by users

### The Recipes

To enable new projects the best opportunity to launch cleanly onto the SushiSwap exchange, the Ingredients listed above can be combined in various ways - creating "Recipes". These recipes provide project teams the flexibility they need to create the launch their token needs to succeed without having to needlessly dedicate their own researches to developing their own launch methods. By making the MISO contracts open sourced, communities and investors can know any launch they are participating in - no matter the "recipe" - comes with sound and trusted mechanics.

Recipes are combinations of smart contracts, bundled together as users (project teams or founders) make selections from MISO's offered options. Recipes may contain one or more options from each Ingredient section, or in some cases may only require one or two Ingredient choices - this depends on the needs of the project and community. MISO ensures a strong launchpad and successful migration event to the SushiSwap exchange, project teams will only need to select their recipe and MISO starts cooking!

With that, we invite you into our kitchen and hope you enjoy the selection. Be sure to offer any suggestions for new ingredients or share your own recipes to be added to the official MISO menu!
