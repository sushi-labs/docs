# Overview

SushiXSwap is Sushi’s cross-chain AMM (automated market maker) that enables users to execute swaps across chains without any additional lockup period or fees. It leverages LayerZero’s Stargate protocol to quickly and effectively swap assets between multiple ecosystems.

SushiXSwap’s real edge over competitors stems from how and where it sources its liquidity for trades, as making a cost-effective cross-chain swap requires deep liquidity not just on the source chain, but on the destination chain as well. SushiXSwap utilizes Sushi’s own liquidity on each and every chain in the cross-chain transaction, allowing users to always trade through deep liquidity and receive the best price for their swaps.

Stargate bridges chains securely without compromising on decentralization, which allows SushiXSwap to scale to any number of chains in the future. To further ensure we can always find the cheapest route and best price between any two tokens on all chains, we will continue to aggregate more bridges in the future. By building SushiXSwap in a modular, composable way, we will simplify the integration of your favorite bridge into our aggregator interface.
