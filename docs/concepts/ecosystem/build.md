# Build

Anyone is welcome to build for and on the Sushi platform. The smart contracts can be interacted with by anyone on the blockchain. All of our code is also open source and available at our Github [here](https://github.com/sushi-labs).

We also have channels on our Discord server (#engineering) where you can discuss development of both our official projects and community projects.

Please reference the docs if you have any questions!
