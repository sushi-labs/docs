# Proposals

Any member of the community is welcome to post a proposal on our forums, but please try and follow the set out template that is shown when creating a thread so that the proposals can be easily read through by the prospective voters. If you desire a poll to be added to your thread, please contact a member of the core team or a community team member.

Your proposal can gain enough traction to be brought up for voting on our Snapshot voting platform by the core team, where the community will vote with **SUSHIPOWAH** to decide the outcome.

Our Snapshot voting platform can be found [here](https://snapshot.org/#/sushigov.eth), where all Sushi proposals are housed.

**SUSHIPOWAH** is our voting metric, and is decided as follows:

Each $SUSHI in the SUSHI-ETH pool is worth **2 SUSHIPOWAH**

Each $SUSHI held via xSUSHI tokens is worth **1 SUSHIPOWAH**

For a vote to pass and become binding, it must gain a quorum of at least 5 million **SUSHIPOWAH**.

**Please note:** To be an eligible voter for any proposal on our Snapshot, you must have **SUSHIPOWAH** from any or all of the 3 above options **_at the time of the vote being started._** This means that you cannot simply buy $SUSHI tokens to vote on an already ongoing vote, and is meant to reduce the risk of influence by whales and flashloaners.
